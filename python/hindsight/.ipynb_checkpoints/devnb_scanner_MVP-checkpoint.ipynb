    "This notebook is used to develop the scanning code for the scanner minimimum viable product (MVP). Each section will demostrate a different feature of the scanner except the final section which will combine the previous sections to create a fully functional scanning code. The final section will then be copied over to a separate python module. The image processing will be done in a separate notebook and subsequent module."
